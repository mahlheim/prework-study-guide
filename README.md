# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This study guide was created to aid students as they go through the prework and prepare for the boot camp. This webpage contains notes on HTML, CSS, git, and JavaScript. The goal of this webpage was to centralize the pertinent information gathered during prework into one, accessible location for review. I learned the information listed on the webpage as well as how to create the webpage itself.
